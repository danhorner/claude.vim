# Included buffer list should be updated
#

Given:
  These test cases create named buffers and verify that only
  selected buffers appear in claude's list

Before (Make Test Buffers):
  let buf1_name = "claude_vader_buf1"
  exe "vsp " . buf1_name
  set buftype=nofile
  normal! ggdG
  let buf1_nr = bufnr(buf1_name)

  let buf2_name = "claude_vader_buf2"
  exe "vsp " . buf2_name
  set buftype=nofile
  normal! ggdG
  let buf2_nr = bufnr(buf2_name)

After (Delete test buffers):
  exe "silent bwipeout " . buf1_nr  " " buf2_nr

Execute (Start claude with marked buffers on):
  let g:claude_only_send_marked_buffers=1

  ClaudeChat
  exe "ClaudeMarkBuffer " . buf1_nr
  :1
  call search("Included buffers")
  let last_line=search("System prompt:","n")

Then ( - Check only marked buffers included):
  AssertNotEqual 0, search(buf1_name, "n", last_line), "Buffer 1 originally included"
  AssertEqual 0, search(buf2_name, "n", last_line), "Buffer 2 originally excluded"
  exe "ClaudeMarkBuffer " . buf1_nr
  exe "ClaudeMarkBuffer " . buf2_nr
* call foreach(getline(".", last_line), 'Log v:val')
  AssertEqual 0, search(buf1_name, "n", last_line), "Buffer 1 excluded after switch"
  AssertNotEqual 0, search(buf2_name, "n", last_line), "Buffer 2 included after switch"

Execute (Start Claude with marked buffers off):
  let g:claude_only_send_marked_buffers=0
  ClaudeChat
  :1
  call search("Included buffers")
  let last_line=search("System prompt:","n")

Then ( - Check all visible buffers included):
  AssertNotEqual 0, search(buf1_name, "n" ), "Buffer 1 included when visible"
  AssertNotEqual 0, search(buf2_name, "n"), "Buffer 2 included when visible"

# Test: Buffer Inclusion Logic

Given:
  Testing buffer inclusion logic for Claude

Before (Make Test Buffers):
  " Create a set of test buffers with different states
  let g:test_buffers = []

  " Regular buffer
  let buf1_name = "claude_test_buf1"
  exe "new " . buf1_name

  " Hidden buffer 
  let buf2_name = "claude_test_buf2"

  setlocal buftype=nofile
  call setline(1, "Content 3")
  let buf3_nr = bufnr(buf3_name)
  call add(g:test_buffers, buf3_nr)

After (Cleanup test buffers):
  for buf in g:test_buffers
    exe "bwipeout! " . buf
  endfor
  unlet g:test_buffers

Execute (Test default inclusion - all visible):
  let g:claude_only_send_marked_buffers = 0
  let included = claude#test.GetIncludedBuffers()
  AssertNotEqual -1, index(included, buf1_nr), "Regular buffer should be included"
  AssertEqual -1, index(included, buf2_nr), "Hidden buffer should not be included"
  AssertNotEqual -1, index(included, buf3_nr), "Nofile buffer should be included"

Execute (Test marked-only inclusion):
  let g:claude_only_send_marked_buffers = 1
  let included = claude#test.GetIncludedBuffers()
  AssertEqual -1, index(included, buf1_nr), "Unmarked buffer should not be included"
  AssertEqual -1, index(included, buf2_nr), "Hidden buffer should not be included"
  AssertEqual -1, index(included, buf3_nr), "Unmarked nofile buffer should not be included"

  " Mark buffer 1 and verify
  exe "ClaudeMarkBuffer " . buf1_nr
  let included = claude#test.GetIncludedBuffers()
  AssertNotEqual -1, index(included, buf1_nr), "Marked buffer should be included"

Execute (Test buffer content collection):
  let g:claude_only_send_marked_buffers = 0
  let contents = claude#test.GetBuffersContent()
  
  " Find content for buf1
  let buf1_content = filter(copy(contents), 'v:val.name =~ "claude_test_buf1"')
  AssertEqual 1, len(buf1_content), "Should find exactly one matching buffer"
  AssertEqual "Content 1", buf1_content[0].contents, "Content should match"

  " Hidden buffer should not be included
  let buf2_content = filter(copy(contents), 'v:val.name =~ "claude_test_buf2"')
  AssertEqual 0, len(buf2_content), "Hidden buffer should not be included"

Execute (Test marking interaction):
  let g:claude_only_send_marked_buffers = 1
  
  " Mark and unmark buffer
  exe "ClaudeMarkBuffer " . buf1_nr
  let included = claude#test.GetIncludedBuffers()
  AssertNotEqual -1, index(included, buf1_nr), "Buffer should be included after marking"
  
  exe "ClaudeMarkBuffer " . buf1_nr
  let included = claude#test.GetIncludedBuffers()
